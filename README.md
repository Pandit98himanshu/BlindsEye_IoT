# BlindsEye_IoT

Vision is one of the most essential human senses and it plays the 
most important role in human perception about surrounding 
environment. Hence, over thousands of papers have been published 
on these subjects that propose a variety of computer vision products 
and services by developing new electronic aids for the blind. This 
report aims to introduce a proposed system that restores a central 
function of the visual system which is the identification of 
surrounding objects. This method is based on the local features 
extraction concept using Convolutional Neural Network layers 
followed by fully connected layers. The simulation results using 
YOLO v3 algorithm and key-points matching showed good accuracy 
for detecting objects. Thus, our contribution is to present the idea of a 
visual substitution system based on features extractions and matching 
to recognize and locate objects in images. For, the purpose of user 
tracking we are sending the personâ€™s live environment and 
demographic data to his / her trusted contacts
